# Wolfe Family Cook Book
Recipes Collected by Jody Wolfe


## Merry Christmas 1996
Through our lives, we have found comfort in the love and traditions of family.
Often we are reminded of this comfort through food - Dad's glumpkies on a cool
autumn day or Mom's chili after a day of sledding at Kearsley Park. After Owen's
birth, I was fortunate to have spent time with Cecilia who gave me a crash course
in home cooking. So I decided to collect the recipes that Tom remembers from his
youth and thought you might enjoy them. It includes a few new favorites from Cecilia.

I hope that my children's memories of family dinners are as fond as Tom's. I
plan on adding our family cookbook and passing it on our kids. I would like to
include recipes from the Wolfe get togethers - such as Kathy's great salads,
Marilyn's cheesecakes, Karen's beans and Betty's potatoes. If you would like to
make this a living cookbook, I would love to be the secretary to keep it up-to-date.
